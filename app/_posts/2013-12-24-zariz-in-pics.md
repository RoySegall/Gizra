[Zariz ](https://github.com/Gizra/zariz) isn't just about static sites. In fact the Zariz module itself isn't aware of any static generation. It's about modeling the content creation around Git, which is a new approach to content staging.

Here are 10 images that will make the whole idea clear.

This is the ``live`` branch  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/0.jpg)

We branch out of it  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/1.jpg)

![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/2.jpg)

<!-- more -->

The new branch is empty. Lets add new content to it  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/3.jpg)

Now that there's new content, the toolbar allows us to merge it back to the ``live`` branch  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/4.jpg)

Zariz supports multiple branching  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/5.jpg)

In the new branch we can see the content that was added in the parent branch  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/6.jpg)

![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/7.jpg)

The debug block shows us the origin of each content  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/8.jpg)

Once we merge the branch, it is locked and cannot be changed  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/9.jpg)

That's the ``live`` branch after the merge  
![]({{BASE_PATH}}/assets/images/posts/zariz2/10.jpg)
