The [UI-Router](http://angular-ui.github.io/) is a routing framework for AngularJS. Ui-Router takes a whole new different approach then the traditional NgRoute which is only based only upon **route URL**. UI-Router extends the rounting by using **States**.
This mean that the application will be capble of changing it's own views by the **state** and not just by the **route URL**.
