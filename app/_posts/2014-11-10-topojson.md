To have an interactive map on your website have never been easier with [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/) and [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/), 
A map with layers to show you the information upon hovering on a city, Any kind of information you want.
 
<!-- more -->

So while i was doing this kind of a map for a client, I used [angular-leaflet-directive](https://github.com/tombatossals/angular-leaflet-directive)
, I get a huge Geojson from the client and with the help of AngularJs and this directive i was able to divide the map into provinces and display lots of information on each province.

But like i said, the Geojson was huge, very slow to load, very slow to download from the server, it took something like (Number here) Which is a life-time,
So what we did is that we converted that to topojson which way much lighter and gave it to the map, The only problem is that the map doesn't know how to read topojson.
I searched and searched the mighty internet but never got a clear answer, i found bits and pieces here and there and put them together until i had a clear way to do it,
So here's what to do,

Bower install or download and include this library [TopoJSON](https://github.com/mbostock/topojson/)

Then fetch the data from the file in an $http AngularJs method or any ajax method if you are using any other library.
