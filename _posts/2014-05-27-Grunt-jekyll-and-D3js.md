At the Beginning of 2014, we worked in a interesting project, to create an mobile web site for an exposition in two different languages for a museum in madrid [Casa del Lector](http://www.gizra.com/content/casa-del-lector/).

Developed a [site](http://gizra.github.io/CDL/) was absorbing, this begun looking components and best practices to achieve the architecture of an Autogenerated Site Backendless.

Sound fancy, ;) but it's just a short way to explain, how some great tools of the Web Platform of today ([gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/), [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/d3) abd [D3](http://d3js.org/)), help us to build amazing sites.

during this process we achive some experiece that could be useful if you developing something similar.

# Backendless, How convert the XML data in node system navigation?

All the data comming from a imported XML (without any XML schema), generated by a 3rd. party desktop application used by the museum.

So, we had to analize, transform and prepare the data will be used by d3js and the jekyll templates.

for this was created 3 [custom task](http://gruntjs.com/creating-tasks) with grunt, because the data could be change many time in a day.

to put all together in an [automated process](https://github.com/Gizra/CDL/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) where we put the XML files in the project folder and then write in the command line:

```bash
grunt serve
```
check locally if everything was fine, and then with;

```bash
grunt build
```

prepare data, generate pages and finally publish the site [github pages](https://pages.github.com/)

to accomplish this we use some great [grunt plugins](http://gruntjs.com/plugins) like [grunt-text-replace](https://github.com/yoniholmes/grunt-text-replace), [he](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/he) HTML encoder/decoder, [underscore](https://github.com/jashkenas/underscore), [grunt-convert](https://github.com/assemble/grunt-convert) and [grunt-gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/grunt-gh-pages).
