Some month ago, we work in a interesting project, to create an mobile site for an exposition in two languages for a museam in madrid. [CDL EN project](http://gizra.github.io/CDL/) [CDL ES project](http://gizra.github.io/CDL-ES/).

So, in the beginning of the project, we know that we will have a lot of XML data from musseum application, no documented, and a predefine design site. But also with the condition that the information will change many times during our development.

<!-- more -->

---

In short, we have a bunch of data in XML files, comming from the client, by mail, without server. How create a site that could change many time as needed in a day? How avoid rework?

So... Yes, yes, we need to find Automatic Way to Generate Site and Apply a Data Visuzlization...

The recipe (Details)



The result (Conclusions)



we need to do the right encoding every time.

Every project in Gizra are a exciting challenge, give you the oportunity to work with poeple really smart, creative and passionate in the (code :) ) best for the clients and the community".
