At the Beginning of 2014, we worked in a interesting project, to create an mobile web site for an exposition in two different languages for a museum in madrid [Casa del Lector](http://www.gizra.com/content/casa-del-lector/).

Sound fancy, ;) but it's just a short way to explain, how some great tools of the Web Platform of today ([gruntjs](http://gruntjs.com/), [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/d3) abd [D3](http://d3js.org/)), help us to build amazing sites.
